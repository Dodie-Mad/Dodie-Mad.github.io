<h2>Intro to AI in the classroom</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence has become a savior to many, particularly to those within education. They allow for me to add on to my learning experience via the tools that they offer. Within the scope of Software Engineering, they are a boon to any programmer through means of debugging, supporting or revisioning code, and breaking down and even explaining them within certain coding environments like Co-Pilot in VSCode. Within 314 specifically, I've used ChatGPT and Co-Pilot to varying degrees of success. They gave me a new outlook on programming while also breaking down concepts in ways that I can actually understand.</p>

<h1>Personal Experience with AI:</h1>
<p>The following are specific examples for when I have or have not used AI:</p>

<h2>Experience WODs</h2>
<p>I would try on first attempts to see what I can manage alone. Only on repeats after having DNF'd the first time would I implement AI like ChatGPT to explain and break down concepts while also watching the video. It was like an uber-explanation of what I was watching. For the most part, the videos were enough and the AI would only reiterate what was shown in the video, albeit sometimes using other methods I wouldn't have thought of. However, towards the latter half of the Experience WODs, especially digits, I'd have started to use ChatGPT and Co-Pilot. This was when there were certain niche codes that I had to ask for, such as those relating to a specific color of a navbar element which used a format I haven't seen.</p>
<h2>In-class Practice WODs</h2>
<p>For the sake of practice, I would do my best without having used AI. I'd use the AI to code the portion that I knew what to do but not how to implement. Other times, though, I'd be stuck, then I would try to reference on the experiences for that topic. And only then would I resort to an outline of what to do. More and more though, as I'd do repeat WODs, I'd have AI make a template for me to skip the fodder parts. I would, however, not use AI as much as I would for in-class wods as these were purely for practice and not for a grade. The mindset is a bit more lenient but I wouldn't use AI for everything. </p>
<h2>In-class WODs</h2>
<p>WODs were very high stress mostly due to the grade associated with them and times like this I refer to AI as a double edged sword as it saved my grade in certain instances but sometimes hampered my learning. In the beginning, I would use AI incessantly-explain this, code that, answer this-which I found out to be a horrible way to learn as I wasn't feeling the pressure I was supposed to. It got better as I stopped using AI to do everything, instead, using it to do debugs and checkups on my code. It didn't cost me any grade, but I needed to practice the methods on my own outside class. AI was particularly useful for making sure I didn't have much DNFs, but my initial over reliance definitely was problematic. One of my main examples of horrid use was in the WOD relating to functional programming where the code I was asking for was much too specific and that really showed me that AI cannot solve all so I just practiced instead and got the hang of it. For the HTML related WODs however, I used AI only for the correcting part. Only when I knew what I had to do but just didn't have enough time to finally do it, I'd have AI whip it up. In the end, I told myself I'll use it, I just need to understand the solution. Towards the later end, it was mostly "Move this to the middle of the page" and "Fix this real quick".</p>
<h2>Essays</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, I didn't pull any "Give me a rough outline" or "Write me an essay but in dumb terms" and paraphrase. I didn't use AI much in the development of my essays except for the naming of "Spaghetti Code No Longer", I reworded the original it gave but I definitely used it in creating a cool title. The title of this is a direct reference to asking AI to whip up an essay and just copy pasting without even checking, hence "Sure, Here's an essay about--" as AI will often start off with that. I do also use it for grammar and spellchecks, though I think I'll use grammarly for this essay instead.</p>
<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>AI definitely played a large role in my personal involvement with my final project. From giving me ideas for new 'issues' to helping figuring out the problem with my code. The biggest example of my AI use was trying ot find new issues or features to add and even explaining the what I was missing from my AddClubForm.tsx file. Delving deeper into that latter part, I had most things, except conflicting variable conditions within the submitHandler which kept the info from my AddClubForm from getting to the schema or dbActions. It was incredibly frustrating and I was greatful that AI could explain what was wrong. Furthermore, AI helped with the creative block that I was facing in creating new features or brainstorming them as far as asking "Features to add that don't include database actions".</p>
<h2>Learning a concept / tutorial</h2>
<p>My usage of AI in learning a concept or going through a tutorial was definitely the highest among any other field here. Asking for a quick explanation of what I was going to learn about helped in priming my learning. It really cut down my reading time and helped me get into the concept and understanding rather than reading tons and tons of documentation. It really fits with the experiene-base learning instead of memorizing everything.</p>
<h2>Answering a question in class or in Discord</h2>
<p>I personally did not use AI in helping in online or in class discussions or questions. Most of the time, I'd be asking for help instead of dishing it out. </p>
<h2>Asking or Answering a Smart-Question</h2>
<p>I didn't use ChatGPT to ask questions on my behalf or to answer them either. Not every problem I had was able to be search on StackOverflow or whatever site had my niche problem, so I would ask in the questions chat and just put it simple in my question.For Example, in the Smart Questions chat I asked "When I run the command " createdb nextjs-application-template " I am prompted to enter my password but I'm not sure what it is and it is not for my postgres" as this is a problem that I found specific to this class instead of asking ChatGPT or Co-pilot which I used more for actual code than these type of commands. </p>
<h2>Coding Example</h2>
<p>AI was crazy useful for making a bunch of code examples. The best example I had of this was learning the different uses of functional programming and the different methods to do things. Asking AI to create an example of a standard iterator algorithm for an array and one using a map() function</p>
