<h1>Study Spots</h1>
<h6>Proposed by Dodie Madriaga</h6>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The Problem: Sometimes students need a spot on campus to study but don't exactly know where and while there are some popular areas, like campus center or the library, some people want a change of environment. There are a variety of places on campus to study, students just need to know where.
</p>
<p>
  The Solution: Study Spots is an app that serves as a hub for all of your study spot needs. Students can use Study Spots to 
</p>
<h3>Mockup Page Ideas</h3>
<p>
  Two Roles in the system: User and Admin. Users (UH Students) can suggest spots for approval, rate, comment, and like study spots. Admins (Staff and Faculty) are users with those same privelages but also have the ability to forcibly remove and add study spots and approve the User's study spot proposals.
</p>
<p>
  Students log into the system and can see what the various study spots are. If they find a suitable study spot that isn't already listed, they can propose a study spot through the 'proposal' page. Once it has been approved, the study spot will show in a list where other users can see it. They can comment on the spot, rate it on a scale of 1 - 5 stars, or report it should it not be suitable.
</p>
<h3>Use Case Ideas</h3>
<p>
  New user gets on the landing page, logs in, goes to the home page or list of all the study spots
</p>
<p>
  Logged in user goes to the proposal page, submitting spot location among other comments
</p>
<p>
  Admin user logs in, approves or rejects the spot proposal
</p>
<h3>Beyond The Basics</h3>
<p>
  For Ideas of more advanced features, we can turn to possibilities of including a direct map of the campus grounds. Using the stylized maps of the campus that we have already, we can have a window that pops up that shows all information plus a smaller section within that window that has the map location. Furthermore, suggesting spots off-campus can become a viability, however there will be more precautions as it is on campus and may not be as well regulated by Admins, who are most usually staff and faculty on campus.
