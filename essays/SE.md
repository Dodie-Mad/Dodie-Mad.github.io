My interests in software engineering and all of the things that require it have piqued my interest. My work is finally becoming more than a one and done code that will never reach the light of day.
Turning my code into possible software that has a practical use outside of class is one of my main desires for my future in software engineering. Though my desired career path is in cyber security,
software engineering is still an important skill to have and understand in that field. 

I hope to develop skills that are not only attractive to potential employers, but are also fun to implement on my own, whether it be for leisure or for a personal project. In whatever skill I gain, 
I want to acquire the skill of time management and managing my priorities. Whether it to get a function out and live or to fix a bug hidden in hundreds of lines of code, I need to do it in an efficient
manner that is up to industry standards.

I hope to experience the real work force in the near future. Be it through internships, mentorships, or a job. Those are essential for character building and for further development of my career.
I want to use those connections to further explore other parts of my career I wouldn't have uncovered otherwise.
