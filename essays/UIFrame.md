  <h1>UI Frameworks</h1>
  <p>
UI frameworks allow for more efficient creation of UIs. They allow for more flexible and useful applications when it comes down to designing UIs of multiple different types of devices, be it on a phone, tablet, or computer. In the use of UI frameworks for web development, they allow for a more consistent design among different devices as they may interpret the CSS or HTML differently.

    Exploring bootstrap along with HTML together have been very interesting. I have had little experience with HTML prior to this experience, so learning HTML and bootstrap sequentially wasn’t something too insane. They are very much alike, in a sense that I didn’t see much change, but bootstrap adding things like a navbar, or at least simplifying the process of creating one, is very helpful. Bootstrap being like an extra add on to make things much more easier than just doing so by raw HTML and CSS. I’m looking forward to the addition of more frameworks to add new design features. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I feel that raw HTML and CSS by themselves is sufficient for most UI design purposes. While it’s painstakingly tedious going through lines and lines of HTML, it is enough. Frameworks are meant to boost and to also streamline that process, adding new UI features or enhancing already existing ones.
