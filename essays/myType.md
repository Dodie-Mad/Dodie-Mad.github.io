  I think that Typescript is a step above what I started out with in my experience with coding, that being Python and Java. It doesn’t feel as ‘basic’ as a programming language like Python, but it’s not as strict as Java. It does seem much more refined that Java in terms of syntax not being so complicated to me. In terms of C and C++, Typescript still feels ‘professional’ and clean but not as convoluted as C/C++. And with respect to software engineering, I am not the most knowledgeable about whether or not it will be good but I would be content with using typescript to develop some software. The syntax isn’t too tedious and has some short cuts while having the whole ‘type’ situation down, just having the type be assumed by the language. 

  I feel that athletic software engineering is a very stressful way to practice, however, that stress brings out a certain reaction to learn and to gain more than just passive learning. It is very akin to athletes and their training and I’m into it, a fail or no fail, not so much, but it adds to the urgency and stress of the situation. Also, not only with the practice, but also the mindset, growth mindset rather than static one. While failure isn’t the end goal, it’s a valuable asset to tune into my learning. So instead of being afraid of failure, embrace it and learn from it, that of which I’m happy to do. 

  The practice WODs give a sense for what I am going to get into, not only in the stress, but the simple fact that there are methods that I had no idea existed, such as the Map() method. It’s more than just simple technical skill but knowledge as well. In a twisted way, I find this style of learning to be enjoyable. It really is the most ‘all in’ you can go, making it either a pass or fail, timed, and probably not at all easy. It definitely is hard, but I will adapt. 

  The biggest take away for me is the acquisition of skills rather than just concepts. Everyone can come to learn something but applying it is a whole different ballgame and I am looking forward to gaining those skills and apply them.
