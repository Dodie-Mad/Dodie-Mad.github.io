I personally like the use of an actual IDE like VSCode vs a web based compiler like Typescript Playground or something like Replit. It starts much faster and is way simpler to open rather than going to a website and waiting for code to open. On a side note, because Typescript Playground has a JavaScript translator on the terminal on the right, it sometimes slows down my laptop to a crawl when dealing with lots of code, like the WODs and practices where we dealt with a huge 600+ line chunk of data. VSCode doesn’t do that and I’m all for it. 

As for ESLint and its errors, I’m finding it very useful for fixing coding and syntax errors, especially shown when first installing ESLint where we had to change “” to ‘’. Red squiggly lines indicate a mistake, usually, or something of concern within the code and is sometimes accompanied with a text explaining what’s happening but not providing the solution to the error itself. I’m glad ESLint does it automatically and tells us the error. 

I don’t find them painful, however I feel like testing it may take a while longer because of iterating it and resubmitting it through the whole process to even find the errors. 

Coding standards seem very good for me to learn and implement. In the professional world, it helps to upkeep a professional looking code that is readable by other programmers. It allows the code that we create to be ‘timeless’ and to changed and implemented regardless of style of the programmer.
