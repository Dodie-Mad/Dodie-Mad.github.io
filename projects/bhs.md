summary: "Working an internship in high school to attain honor graduate for Henry Perrine Baldwin High School"
---
For the purpose of a challenge and obtaining a golden stole of my now alma mater, I undertook senior project Baldwin High School, for the ultimate goal of Honor Graduate,
with mine focusing in STEM, as I was doing it under a digital media class. I was given the option of making a PSA video, An essay with a call to action, or to work an internship. 
I chose to take the internship. 

The contents of the internship are to record videos, edit content, and to post them on the organization's media pages. Those were the duties given to me by my mentor. My project advisor
also told me to log the internship as it went on and to notice changes in my work but also mindset. The tasks were not easy, yet simple, and sometimes I would be free of my workload, other times
I would be under insane work stress. These internship experiences allowed me to balance work, school, and my personal life. I worked solo, so there was not much team building, but I got to 
talk and socialize with the other workers in the different jobs in the same organization. 

To follow the internship, I would occasionally reflect on what I have done in the week and note down any changes. A basic task on the surface, it allowed me to take a look at what I have done 
objectively and to critique and improve it on a weekly basis.

I completed said internship, passed the pannel that I was put through by industry professionals, and got golden stole.
